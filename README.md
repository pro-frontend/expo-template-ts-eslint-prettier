# expo-template-ts-eslint-prettier

Template-based project with setupped modules, debugger, unit tests and much more!

Usuing this repo - the simplest way to run your project from scratch, test a hypotesis or create `MVP`. It also suitable for a production-ready product/code base of React-based components when you are planning to start a cross-platform React Native application with using an `Expo` framework.

This template is based on empty template, which is genered by [Expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/). Project oriented to support of TypeScript.

### Included features:

1. EsLint, Prettier, TypeScript;
2. Unit testing setupped according [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.io/guides/testing-with-jest/);
3. Standart config of commits through Commitizen with CLI support: [Commitizen documentation](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/). You `don't need` global cli installation for using cz-cli;
4. React-devtools - special module, giving a simple and convinient way of debugging your application. Read more about it in chapter about commands (scripts from package.json) - `Readme part still in develop`.
5. Support of Styled-Components. Official Expo documentation [recommends](https://docs.expo.io/guides/using-styled-components/#getting-started) to use `styled-components/native` module instead this one: `styled-components`.
